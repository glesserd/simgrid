Welcome to SimGrid's documentation! %As you may know, SimGrid is an actively
developed research software and contains many features. This documentation is
\c "work in progress" (and we need the community's help to improve this
documentation! If you're ready to step up and help us, see Section \ref
contributing "Contributing"), but many features are already well described.

%As for many projects, our documentation consists mostly of documentation
for \ref gs_new_users "new" and \ref gs_experienced_users "experienced" users, but
we also have several pages plus a technical documentation; in addition to that, we have
also written many \ref gs_examples "examples" that you can easily adapt to your
own needs. This page gives you a brief overview of available resources.

\section gs_introduction Introduction, Installation and how we can help

| Document name   | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| \ref tutorial   | Introduces the user to basic features of SimGrid. |
| \ref install    | Explains how SimGrid can be installed; this covers Windows as well as Linux; plus, it shows how to install from a package or how to install from source. |
| \ref FAQ        | Our FAQ                                           |
| \ref help       | There are many ways to find answers to your questions. This document lists them. |

\section gs_new_users Documentation for new users

| Document name     | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| \ref tutorial     | Introduces the user to basic features of SimGrid. |
| \ref install      | Explains how SimGrid can be installed; this covers Windows as well as Linux; plus, it shows how to install from a package or how to install from source. |
| [Online Tutorials](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials.html) | These tutorials cover most of the basics and might be valuable for what you want to do, especially the [SimGrid User 101](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/simgrid-use-101.pdf). |
| \ref MSG_examples | This document explains several tests that we wrote for MSG; these tests are working simulations and you may learn something from looking at them. |

In order to actually use SimGrid, three steps are necessary:

\li Step 1: \ref platform
\li Step 2: \ref options
\li Step 3: \ref deployment

\section gs_experienced_users Documentation for experienced users

| Document name     | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| \ref tracing      | Shows how the behavior of a program can be written to a file so that it can be analyzed. |
| \ref bindings     | You can write your application in Java, if you prefer. |
| \ref pls          | You can use the NS3 simulation models instead of our own. |
| \ref inside       | If you want to contribute or obtain a deeper understanding of SimGrid, this is the right location. |

\section gs_examples Examples shipped with SimGrid

SimGrid ships with many examples, detailed in Section \ref
MSG_examples. You can find them in the folder \c examples/. Especially
when you're looking for examples on how to use a specific XML-tag,
this will prove valuable, as you can easily search through all the
files with tools like \c grep.


Here is the output of a quick search for examples for \ref pf_trace "trace_connect":

\verbatim
% grep -R -i -n --include="*.xml" "trace_connect" .
./simdag/two_hosts.xml:22:   <trace_connect trace="Tremblay_power" element="Tremblay" kind="POWER"/>
./platforms/two_hosts_platform_with_availability_included.xml:24:<trace_connect kind="POWER" trace="A" element="Cpu A"/>
./platforms/two_hosts_platform_with_availability_included.xml:25:<trace_connect kind="HOST_AVAIL" trace="A_failure" element="Cpu A"/>
./platforms/two_hosts_platform_with_availability_included.xml:26:<trace_connect kind="POWER" trace="B" element="Cpu B"/>
\endverbatim
