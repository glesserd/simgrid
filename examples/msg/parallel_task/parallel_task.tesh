> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) Switching to the L07 model to handle parallel tasks.
> [  0.000000] (1:test@Fafard) First, build a classical parallel task, with 1 Gflop to execute on each node, and 10MB to exchange between each pair
> [ 20.625396] (1:test@Fafard) Then, build a parallel task involving only computations and no communication (1 Gflop per node)
> [ 41.247354] (1:test@Fafard) Finally, trick the ptask to do a 'remote execution', on host Tremblay
> [ 51.441554] (1:test@Fafard) Goodbye now!
> [ 51.441554] (0:maestro@) Simulation done.
